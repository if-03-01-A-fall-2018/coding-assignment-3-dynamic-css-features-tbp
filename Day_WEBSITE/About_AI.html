        <h1>Artifial Intelligence</h1>
        <hr>
        </br>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), sometimes also called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. In computer science, AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
        </p>
        <p>The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring "intelligence" are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Tesler's Theorem, "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from Artificial Intelligence, having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.
        </p>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years it experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as the "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences. Subfields have also been based on social factors such as particular institutions or the work of certain researchers.
        </p>
        <p>The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals. Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many others.
        </p>
        <p>The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it". This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence which are issues that have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated. Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment. However, Google will host a global contest to develop AI that is beneficial for humanity.
        </p>
        <p>In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.
        </p>
        <p>AI systems will typically demonstrate at least some of the following behaviors associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.</p>
        <h2>What are the uses of AI?</h2>
        <p>AI is used to recommend what you should buy next online, to understand what you say to virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, to recognise who and what is in a photo, to spot spam, or detect credit card fraud.</p>
        <h2>What are the different types of AI?</h2>
        <p>At a very high level Artificial Intelligence can be split into two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.</p>
        <p>Narrow AI is what we see all around us in computers today: intelligent systems that have been taught or have learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.</p>
        <p>This type of machine intelligence is evident in speech and language recognition of the Siri virtual assistant on the Apple iPhone, in the vision-recognition systems on self-driving cars, in the recommendation engines that suggest products you might like based on what you bought in the past. Unlike humans, these systems can only learn or be taught how to do specific tasks, which is why they are called narrow AI.</p>
        <h2>What can Narrow AI do?</h2>
        <p>There is a vast number of emerging applications for narrow AI, ranging from interpreting video feeds from drones carrying out visual inspections of infrastructure such as oil pipelines, organizing personal and business calendars and responding to simple customer-service queries to co-ordinating with other intelligent systems to carry out tasks like booking a hotel at a suitable time and location, helping radiologists to spot potential tumors in X-rays, flagging inappropriate content online and detecting wear and tear in elevators from data gathered by IoT devices.</p>
        <h2>What can General AI do?</h2>
        <p>Artificial General Intelligence is very different as it is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets. This kind of AI is more commonly seen in movies, the likes of HAL in 2001 or Skynet in The Terminator, which does not exist today, leaving AI experts fiercely divided over how soon it will become a reality.</p>
        <p>A survey conducted among four groups of experts in 2012/13 by AI researchers Vincent C MÃ¼ller and philosopher Nick Bostrom reported a 50 percent chance that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would be developed between 2040 and 2050, rising to 90 percent by 2075. The group went even further, predicting that the so-called 'superintelligence' - which Bostrom defines as "any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest" - was expected some 30 years after the achievement of AGI.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, some other AI experts believe that such projections are wildly optimistic given our limited understanding of the human brain, and believe that AGI is still centuries away.</p>
