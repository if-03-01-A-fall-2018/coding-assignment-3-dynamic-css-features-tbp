      <h1>Machine Learning Tasks</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Machine learning tasks are typically classified into several broad categories: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. As special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback.
        </li>
        <li>Semi-supervised learning: The computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing.
        </li>
        <li>Active learning: The computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling.
        </li>
        <li>Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
        </li>
        <li>Reinforcement learning: Data (in form of rewards and punishments) are given only as feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent
        </li>
      </ol>
