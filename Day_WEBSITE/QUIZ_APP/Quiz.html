    <p class = "questions">An example of Maching Learning would be: </p>
    <input id = "textbox" type = "text" name = "question1">

    <p class = "questions">What is Deep Learning?</p>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question2" value = "True">Learns from large volumes of structured and unstructured data and unses complex algorithms to train a neural network.<br>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question2" value = "Wrong">Deep Learning is using machine learning to find ways to make business operations more effective.<br>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question2" value = "Wrong">Yes, I agree.<br>

    <p class = "questions">How does deep learning differ from conventional machine learning?</p>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question3" value = "True">Deep learning algorithms can handle more data and run with less supervision from data scientists.<br>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question3" value = "Wrong">Machine learning is simpler, and thus requires less oversight by data analysts than deep learning does.<br>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question3" value = "Wrong">There are no real differences between the two -- they are the same tool with different names.<br>

    <p class = "questions">Which of the following is a technique frequently used in machine learning and AI programs?</p>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question4" value = "Wrong">Classification of data into categories based on attributes.<br>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question4" value = "Wrong">Grouping similar objects into clusters of related events.<br>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question4" value = "Wrong">Identifying relationships between events to predict when one will follow the other.<br>
    <input type = "radio" id = "mc" name = "question4" value = "True">All of the above are common machine learning techniques.<br>
