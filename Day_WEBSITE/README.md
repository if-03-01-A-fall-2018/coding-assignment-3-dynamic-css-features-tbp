## INFO ABOUT THE WEB-PAGE

## Start
- [`IMPORTANT Note`]:
There are 2 different websites linked to each other. There is "*light mode*" and "*Dark mode*".

User always starts on the "light page" [`AI.html`] (AI.HTML), which also means that this is the MAIN FRONT PAGE!!

On the main page there is the my best work I did and that is the Timeline. The timeline is user friendly and active.
